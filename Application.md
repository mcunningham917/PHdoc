## Revealing how glacial erosion limits the height of tropical mountain ranges


Absent glacial erosion, mountain range height is limited by the 
rate of bedrock river incision, and is thought
to asymptote to a steady-state elevation as erosion and rock uplift rates converge. 
For glaciated mountains, there is evidence that range height 
is limited by glacial erosion rates, 
which vary cyclically with glaciations. The strongest evidence for glacial limitation 
is at mid-latitudes, where range-scale hypsometric maxima (modal elevations) lie within 
the bounds of late-Pleistocene snowline variation. In the tropics, where mountain 
glaciation is sparse, range elevation is generally considered to be fluvially limited
and glacial limitation is discounted. Here we present topographic evidence to the
contrary. By applying both old and new methods of hypsometric analysis to high
mountains in the tropics, we show that (a) the majority are subject to glacial 
erosion linked to a perched base-level set by the snowline or equilibrium line 
altitude (ELA), and (b) many truncate through glacial erosion towards the cold-phase
ELA. Evaluation of the hypsometric analyses at two field sites where glacial 
limitation is seemingly marginal reveals how glacio-fluvial processes act in 
tandem to accelerate erosion near the cold-phase ELA during warm phases and to
reduce their preservation potential. We conclude that glacial erosion truncates
high tropical mountains on a cyclic basis: zones of glacial erosion expand during 
cold periods, and contract during warm periods as fluvially-driven escarpments 
encroach and destroy evidence of glacial action. The inherent disequilibrium of
this glacio-fluvial limitation complicates the concept of time-averaged erosional
steady-state, making it meaningful only
on long time-scales far exceeding the interval between major glaciations.
