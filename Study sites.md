#### *Revealing glacial limitation of tropical mountain ranges*


Seeking to broadly assess the potential for glacial limitation in
tropical mountain ranges, we reviewed all those ranges close to the
height of the cpELA. Within this broad selection, we sought a subset
uncontaminated by processes that would distort or complicate any signal
of glacial limitation. In particular, we wanted to avoid any confusion
between the passive uplift of low-relief terrain from that of *in-situ*
glacial erosion. The potential for such confusion is strongest in the
Peruvian/Bolivian Andes, the Sierra Madre of Mexico and Guatemala, the
central highlands of Papua New Guinea, all of which are characterized by
large, internally drained plateaus disconnected from external
base-level; as such, these regions were excluded from our analysis.
Volcanism is another complicating factor, in that glaciated volcanoes
have undergone a mix of construction and erosion that cannot easily be
disentangled. Therefore, glaciated volcanoes such as those in East
Africa (Mt. Kilimanjaro and Mt. Kenya) and Papua New Guinea (Mt. Giluwe)
were excluded from our analysis. A final constraint was that each range
must be circumferentially well-connected to external base-level
(sea-level or lake-level) by relatively short fluvial links.



The following ten tropical mountain ranges remain and were selected for
analysis:

<ol type="a">
  <li>Leuser Range, Aceh, Indonesia</li>
  <li>Central Range, Taiwan</li>
  <li>Talamanca Range, Costa Rica</li>
  <li>Crocker Range, Borneo</li>
  <li>Finisterre Range, Papua New Guinea</li>
  <li>Owen Stanley Range, Papua New Guinea</li>
  <li>Merauke Range, Papua</li>
  <li>MÃ©rida Range, Venezuela</li>
  <li>Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, Colombia</li>
  <li>Rwenzori, East Africa</li>
</ol>
