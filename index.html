<!-- <h3>Progressive hypsometry</h3> -->

<p>
Progressive hypsometry (PH) involves the measurement of hypsometric maxima in nested catchments
 whose outlets span from the lowest to the highest elevations in a mountain range. 
 It consists of three major components: 
 (i) segmentation of the landscape into large catchments, 
 (ii) calculation of hypsometry along flow paths, 
 (iii) segmentation into nested subcatchments characterized by a shared modal elevation.
