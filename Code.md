## Matlab code

The progressive hypsometry algorithm is implemented in `Matlab` and requires `TopoToolbox`
to run. 

The `Matlab` code is archive as a `GitHub` repository at [PHtools](PHtools). 
This repo is very simple: it consists of a 
[`Core/`](https://github.com/mcunningham917/PHtools/tree/master/Core) folder 
containing the set of scripts needed to peform progressive hypsometry, 
and an [Example/](https://github.com/mcunningham917/PHtools/tree/master/Example) 
folder containing a demo driver script
[`CostaRica.m`](https://github.com/mcunningham917/PHtools/tree/master/Example/CostaRica.m) 
and a 
[`Defaults.m`](https://github.com/mcunningham917/PHtools/tree/master/Example/Defaults.m) 
script that can be shared by multiple driver scripts.
