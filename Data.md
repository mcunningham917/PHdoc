## Digital elevation data used to assess glacial limitation


All topographic analysis was performed on 1-arcsecond (projected at 30 m resolution) 
Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) digital topography (Farr et al., 2007). 
SRTM data were acquired using 
[U.S. Geological Survey Earth Explorer](https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov).
